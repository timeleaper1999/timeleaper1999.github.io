      <description>Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.&amp;mdash; Carl Jung The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.&amp;mdash; Carl Jung Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.</description>
