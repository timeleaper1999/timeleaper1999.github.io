      <description>Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.&amp;mdash; Carl Jung The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.&amp;mdash; Carl Jung Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.</description>

If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
